# Welcome â˜•

## This is a repo I created for a Java course I am taking at Coursera

### I am not planning on writing extensive documentation for it. The goal here is to learn as much Java as I can

## Week 2 

### In week one, there was no assignment, so I will ignore it here.

### For the assignment on Week 2, I made the changes at the provided file. I will be doing the same for the next assignments.

### Apparently, Google's API limits the amount of requests so I changed the Map's provider.
