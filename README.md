# Welcome â˜•

## This is a repo I created for a Java course I am taking at Coursera

### I am not planning on writing extensive documentation for it. The goal here is to learn as much Java as I can
### For this course, the instructors use and recommend BlueJ as the environment. Because I have been coding using VSCode on Ubuntu for a long time, I decided to stick with it as my IDE.
